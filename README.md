# Flipkart_Customer_Service_Satisfaction
A machine learning project to analyze and predict customer service satisfaction on Flipkart using customer reviews. Includes sentiment analysis, feature extraction, and model training for classification.
This project analyzes Flipkart customer reviews to evaluate and predict customer service satisfaction using Machine Learning techniques. The goal is to understand user sentiment and determine how well Flipkart is meeting customer expectations through its service.

Text data is preprocessed using NLP techniques such as tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization, and TF-IDF vectorization. Sentiment labels (positive, negative, neutral) are derived either manually or using rule-based labeling, and multiple classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, and Random Forests are applied to build predictive models.

Performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices. Data visualizations highlight sentiment distribution, frequent keywords, and satisfaction trends.

This project demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to customer feedback analytics, enabling e-commerce platforms to improve service quality and user experience.
